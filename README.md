# sentisR
Functions to help with bioinformatics analysis

Â To install the package you must first install the biomaRt package available from Bioconductor here: https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/biomaRt.html
 
 
For now only 1 function exists in the package, ensg_to_hgnc, which turns a table of ENSG ID rownames to a table with deduplicated HGNC ID rownames
